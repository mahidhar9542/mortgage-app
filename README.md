# Quick Close Mortgage Application

A modern mortgage application with secure authentication and loan management features.

## Features

- üîê Secure authentication with email/password
- ‚úâÔ∏è Password reset via email
- üë• Role-based access control
- üì± Responsive design
- üöÄ Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- üîÑ Real-time updates
- üìß Email notifications

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mortgage-app

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@quickclosemortgage.com

# SMTP Configuration (for production)
# SMTP_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_SECURE=false # true for 465, false for other ports
# SMTP_USER=your-email@example.com
# SMTP_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

For development, you can use [Ethereal Email](https://ethereal.email/) for testing email functionality. No configuration is needed for development - emails will be captured by ethereal.email and you can view them in their web interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or later
- npm 7.x or later
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quick-close-mortgage-flow
   ```

2. Run the setup script (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   
   Or on Windows (using Git Bash or WSL):
   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```

3. The setup script will:
   - Check for Node.js and npm
   - Install dependencies
   - Create a `.env.local` file with default configuration
   - Verify MongoDB connection (if installed)

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (copy from `.env.example` and update values)

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Authentication

The application includes the following authentication features:

- **Sign Up**: Create a new account with email and password
- **Sign In**: Log in with your credentials
- **Forgot Password**: Request a password reset link
- **Reset Password**: Set a new password using a secure token
- **Protected Routes**: Certain routes require authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Different user roles have different permissions

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm start` - Start the production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm test` - Run tests (coming soon)

### Testing Email in Development

During development, you can test the email functionality using [Ethereal Email](https://ethereal.email/). The application is pre-configured to use Ethereal in development mode.

1. Start the development server
2. Trigger an email (e.g., password reset)
3. Check your Ethereal inbox at [https://ethereal.email/messages](https://ethereal.email/messages)
   - Username and password will be logged in the console when the server starts

### Database

The application uses MongoDB as the database. You can use:

- Local MongoDB instance (default)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) (cloud)
- Any other MongoDB-compatible database

Update the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env.local` file to point to your database.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-docs) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
